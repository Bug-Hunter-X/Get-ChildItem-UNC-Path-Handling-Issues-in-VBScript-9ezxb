The most reliable solution involves using a different approach altogether to retrieve file information from network shares.  Here are two potential alternatives:

**1. Using the FileSystemObject with error handling:**

```vbscript
Set fso = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
Set folder = fso.GetFolder("\\server\share\path")

On Error Resume Next
For Each file In folder.Files
    WScript.Echo file.Name
Next
On Error GoTo 0

Set folder = Nothing
Set fso = Nothing
```

This approach utilizes explicit error handling (`On Error Resume Next`) to gracefully manage potential errors during file enumeration. 

**2. Employing WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation):**

```vbscript
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\server\root\cimv2")
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery _
    ("Select * from CIM_DataFile Where Drive = '\\server\share\path' ")

For Each objItem in colItems
    WScript.Echo objItem.Name
Next
```

WMI provides a more powerful and consistent way to interact with the file system, offering better handling of various edge cases.  Adjust the WMI query as needed to target specific file types or attributes.
